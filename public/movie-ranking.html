<h1>Best Movies According to Ayush</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Kimi no Na wa [Your Name]</h3>
<p>A perfect blend of story and animation, beautifully portrayed characters and that special bond between them. 
Accurately placed music with one of the best climax. You'll just love it.</p>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Hats off to this man, how perfectly he put up the story and push through it. Went crazy with concept of physics
that just blew off minds of science geeks and the community.</p>

<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>This put up that VILLIAN is the power to the story and success of a movie. Avengers Endgame is another perfect
example for this.
